# domain-dynamicmapper
A little framework for mapping domain objects between layers from  a system

For those one who suffered once from not be able to use some third party libraries (e.g. google reflections api or org.modelmapper) neither higher versions of Java to get the job done.
Hence, here's my solution, work at least with JAVA SE 7 (might also  work with java 6, although, some adjustments are required to be made)
